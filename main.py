# Function to download and transcribe videos in a channel in parallel
def download_and_transcribe(channel_url, max_workers=4):
    """Download and transcribe all videos from a YouTube channel URL.

    This function uses parallel processing to handle multiple downloads and transcriptions simultaneously,
    making it faster to process large channels or playlists. The `max_workers` parameter controls the number
    of tasks that can run in parallel, allowing users to adjust it based on their systemâ€™s capabilities.

    **Why Use Parallel Processing?**
    - By using parallel processing, we can significantly speed up the download and transcription process,
      especially when dealing with a large number of videos.
    - Instead of processing one video at a time, this function allows us to handle multiple tasks concurrently,
      making better use of available system resources.

    **Adjusting max_workers for Performance**
    - The `max_workers` parameter defines the maximum number of videos processed at the same time.
    - Increasing `max_workers` can improve speed but may lead to higher CPU and memory usage.
    - Decreasing `max_workers` reduces resource usage but slows down processing.
    - If you find your system is overloaded, try lowering `max_workers` to a number that balances performance with system capacity.

    Args:
        channel_url (str): URL of the YouTube channel to download and transcribe videos from.
        max_workers (int): Maximum number of concurrent tasks for parallel processing.
